            <h2 style="color: white;">1. Ankusha (Elephant Goad)</h2>
            <p style="color: white;">A goad is carried by the mahout or elephant driver. The sharp point and hook was
                used to guide the animal to behave or move in a specific way, making it a crucial tool for hunting
                expeditions. The steel blade here features fantastical creatures, while the brass butt is formed by a
                dog-like animal issuing from a tiger’s mouth. Since it is ornately decorated, it may have also been
                intended for display in ceremonial processions. The elephant goad is a tool employed by mahout in the
                handling and training of elephants. It consists
                of a hook (usually bronze or steel) which is attached to a 60–90 cm (2.0–3.0 ft) handle, ending in a
                tapered end.</p>

        <p style="color: white;">A hunting sword is a type of single-handed short sword that dates to the 12th Century.
            A hunting sword usually has a straight, single-edged, pointed blade typically no more than 36 inches long. A
            sword is a bladed melee weapon intended for cutting or thrusting that is longer than a knife or dagger,
            consisting of a long blade attached to a hilt. The precise definition of the term varies with the historical
            epoch or the geographic region under consideration. The blade can be straight or curved. Thrusting swords
            have a pointed tip on the blade, and tend to be straighter; slashing swords have a sharpened cutting edge on
            one or both sides of the blade, and are more likely to be curved. Many swords are designed for both
            thrusting and slashing.</p>
